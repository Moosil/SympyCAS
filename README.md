# Note for Mr. Nielsen
Hi Mr. Nielsen, I have done a lot on this calculator, and it's pretty much not the same calculator that we were tasked to make. I have used sympy to do all the maths side of stuff, and intend to improve the UI to be more like the CAS.

I have attached both the updated file 'gui_calculator.py' and the old version which uses similar techniques to in the video and was the backbones of some of this version 'old_gui_calculator.py'. I made the maths on that one by myself but gave up trying to add function.

As for the newer iteration of this calculator, not everything works and the UI isn't that informative. I want to add a hover popup or something to tell users what each function needs because it's not very self-explanatory **or** make the UI better to be more like the CAS (with the empty fields and stuff). I'm pretty sure that would require separating the front end stuff from the backend and making the UI less of a representation of what is actually being parsed as a calculation.

I will probably continue making this project as it is quite interesting, but it is quite rushed and don't expect features to all work

TLDR; 'gui_calculator.py' uses sympy for maths and 'old_gui_calculator.py' uses custom code for calculation and is older. The newer one needs more polish and some things may not work as intended.
